Vimalayas
=========

Vimalayas is a cool-toned blue color scheme for Vim which borrows the color
palette and much of the theming from [Nord Vim][]. Nord is an excellent color
scheme and I highly recommend trying it out.

I created Vimalayas because Nord was a bit too colorful for my taste and I
wanted a more toned down color scheme that emphasized the calming blue tones.
